# Finance Tracker by Jovan

This is a capstone project to consolidate my learnings for The Ultimate React Course 2024 by Jonas Schmedtmann. This Finance tracker is built using React frontend framework, and incorporates many React libraries such as React Router, Recharts, Context API, Redux, and more.

## Application Features

1. Authentication: login and logout feature for users
2. User settings: users can edit their name, password, email, etc from the settings page
3. Dashboard: quick summary of overall finances using charts and diagrams, with key statistics of the user's expenditure
4. Transaction: users can upload their expenditures as well as their income into the application and categorise their spendings and income sources into a table, which shows the history of transactions
